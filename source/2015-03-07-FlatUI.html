<p>I am implementing a Udemy like online course web application, <a href= "flixter-weng-sin.herokuapp.com">Flixter</a>. I set up the assets pipeline, installed a few gems including the devise gem for the user model. After the set up, I need to consider what I need to create in my database. The most important feature is definitely the courses. There should be two types of users , instructors and students. I assumed each course only has one instructor. Therefore, in order to identify whether the current user is an instructor or a student, I can just check if the current user is the creactor of a specific course, so I migrated a course table to store all courses and created an association between the user and course model. An instructor or user if you will, can teach many courses, but a course can only have one owner. 

<p>I also found an awesome UI Kit called <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-U">Flat UI</a>, which made my web application looked a lot more appealing than what Firehose taught, which only used Twitters Bootstrap. It is a UI kit based on Bootstrap. It provides a flat design theme css and javascript files, which overwrites the default Bootstrap's style. Therefore, all Bootstrap classes can still be used, but now the website looks flat and much cleaner. The one I'm using is free, but if you want to use more advanced features, there is a pro version for $39.99. The default theme of Flat UI is green. I thought it looks really nice, but I cannot have all my websites and applications look green, right? So Flat UI provided a list of colors for you to customize the css file instead of using the default color, http://flatuicolors.com/. However, I haven't not figured out how to change the color on my web application yet. I think my website looks good for now, but will definitely put more time on this.</p>
