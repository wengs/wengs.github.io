<p>Today, I enrolled in an online coding bootcamp called Firehose Project after tons of research. I initially planned to join Bloc, but the communication between Marco, one of the cofounders of Firehose Project, gave me a lot of confidence to hop into the Firehose Project. Marco talked about the curriculum in an info session, which addressed a lot of my concerns. Their info seesions are live on YouTube, so they can answer any questions if you have questions during the info session. Antoher reason I did not choose Bloc is Bloc did not explicitly say they had a group project included in their curriculum. They did answer me I would have access to former and current students, so I could collaborate with them to do any side projects. That was great. However, I wanted a little more than that. It would be great if an instructor is here all the time to guide the group over the whole project. This is the disadvantage of online bootcamps because a lot of well-known on-site bootcamps introduce pair-programming and group projects at the early stage of a the courses. I thought that being able to work as a team is one of the most important skills for a developer. It is also a critical factor for potential employers to consider in an interview. They would rather work with a person who can blend in to their team easily than work with an individual who is really good at coding, but does not know how to communicate.

<p>One thing I like Firehose Project is that they are going to teach you the essential computer science skills. After the info session, I started their Pre-work. I was able to see the curriculum in my user page. I saw there was a tab called, coding challenges, which needed students to write plain Ruby code. Therefore, I thought this should be the right bootcamp I should join.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Ken, another cofounder of Firehose Project, was extremely helpful. He answered whatever coding questions I came up during the Pre-work process. In Firehose Project's Pre-work, they suggested the website, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, for pre-students to get used to Ruby syntax. The website is very useful. I thought Ruby Primer is also very useful because it explains some of the concepts, for example, class, objects, methods, etc. clearly. After a week of preparation, I solved two coding challenges and finally became a Firehoser. I am looking forward to building some Rails apps !!
