<p>Today, I enrolled in an online coding bootcamp called Firehose Project after tons of research. I initially planned to joined Bloc, but the communication between Marco, one of the cofounders of Firehose Project, gave me a lot of confidence to try the Firehose. Marco talked about the curriculum in a info session, which addressed a lot of my concerns. One of the biggest reason I did not choose Bloc is Bloc did not explicitly say they had a group project included in their curriculum because being able to work as a team is one of the most important skills for a developer. It is also an critical factor for potential employers to consider in a interview. They would rather work with a person who can blend in to their team easily than work with an individual who is really good at coding, but does not know how to communicate.

<p>Therefore, I started doing their Pre-work right after the coding session. Ken, another cofounder, was extremely helpful. He answered whatever coding questions I came up during the Pre-work process. In Firehose Project's Pre-work, they suggested the website, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, for pre-students to get used to Ruby syntax. The website is very useful. I thought Ruby Primer is also very useful because it explains some of the concepts, for example, class, objects, methods, etc. clearly. After a week of preparation, I solved two coding challenges and finally became a Firehoser.
