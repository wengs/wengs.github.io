    <h3>An Alternative to Twitter Bootstrap</h3>
    <h5></h5>
    <p>I started learning a new front-end framework, Bourbon this week. I used what I learned to create this blog. To start, I watched phpacademy's tutorial on Youtube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ItNE_DX6Cc">How to make your CSS awesome with Bourbon, Neat, Bitters and Refills!</a>. In the video, Travis used the good example of Avengers to describe what Bourbon is. If Bourbon were the American Captain, then Neat, Bitters and Refills would be Thor, Iron Man and Hulk. </p>

<p>So what is Bourbon? Bourbon is just a mixins library for sass. Unlike Bootstrap, it will not install pre-defined classes to websites, so the appearance of websites will not change until we apply the mixins. We will have more control on what will be actually added. The mixins allow users to write DRY code, on the other words, less code, but achieve the same results as CSS. It is not very powerful though, so we need others members in the Averagers team, Neat. </p>

<p>Neat is a grid-system built on Bourbon. It allows users to create an responsive website easily. It divides a page into 12 columns, 4 columns for mobile sites. For example, By simply calling @include outer-container, the content will be centered accordingly. If you want to divide a page into 2 sectons that have the same size, you can call @include span-columns(6) on each class, which means each class spans 6 columns.</p>

<p>If you still want the pre-defined style, Bourbon has Bitters, which provides necessary variables, styles, structures, forms and grid settings. Lastly, in order to add some super power, we need Refills. Refills provides components, such as, footers, navigation-bars, hero-section, etc. They are all available on Refills website, so users can just copy and paste them on their websites. This is the biggest advantage of Bourbon. Users only take the components they need, so when users try to customize the websites, pre-defined classes will not get in the way and produce unpredictable results.</p>

<p>Some people may ask- Does that mean Bourbon is better than Bootstrap? It depends. They both have their pros and cons. On the one hand, Bourbon provides the flexibility for designers to tailor websites. On the other hand, Bootstrap allows designers to build websites fast. I like Bourbon a lot, but at this point, Bootstrap is still a better option for me because I want to focus on the backend.</p>
