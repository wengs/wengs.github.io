    <h3>An Awesome UI Kit - Flat UI</h3>
    <h5></h5>
    <p>I am implementing a Udemy like online course web application, <a href= "http://flixter-weng-sin.herokuapp.com">Flixter</a>. I set up the assets pipeline, installed a few gems including the devise gem for the user model. After the set up, I need to consider what I need to create in my database. The most important feature is definitely the courses. There should be two types of users , instructors and students. I assumed each course only has one instructor. Therefore, in order to identify whether the current user is an instructor or a student, I can just check if the current user is the creactor of a specific course, so I migrated a course table to store all courses and created an association between the user and course model. An instructor or user if you will, can teach many courses, but a course can only have one owner. 

<p>I also found an awesome UI Kit called <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-U">Flat UI</a>, which made my web application looked a lot more appealing than what Firehose taught, which only used Twitters Bootstrap. It is a UI kit based on Bootstrap. It provides a flat design theme css and javascript files, which overwrites the default Bootstrap's style. Therefore, all Bootstrap classes can still be used, but now the website looks flat and much cleaner. I am using the free version, but if you want to use more advanced features, there is a pro version for $39.99. The default theme of Flat UI is green. I thought it looks really nice, but I cannot have all my websites and applications look green, right? So Flat UI provided a list of colors for you to customize the css file instead of using the default color, http://flatuicolors.com/. However, I haven't not figured out how to change the color on my web application yet. I think my website looks good for now, but will definitely put more time on this.</p>
