<p>I am implemented an Udemy like online course web application. I set up the devise gem for user model. The most exciting thing is I found an awesome UI Kit called Flat UI, which made my web application looked a lot more appealing than what Firehose taught, which only used Twitters Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Flat UI is a UI kit based on Bootstrap, but it provided a flat theme css and javascript file overwriting the default Bootstrap's style. Therefore, all Bootstrap classes can still be used, but now the website looks flat and much cleaner. Flat UI also provided a list of colors for you to customize the css file instead of using the default color. However, I haven't not figured out how to change the color on my web application yet. I think my website looks good now and should put more time on the backend first.</p>
